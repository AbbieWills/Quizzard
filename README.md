# Quizzard


# Description 
The Quizzard is an interactive trivia game designed to inspire and engage children in non-STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) subjects. The game aims to address the declining interest in non-STEM subjects among kids in school and encourage their active participation in these areas of study.

Through a fun and interactive quiz format, the project aims to make STEM subjects enjoyable for children. The game covers a wide range of topics, including music, english, drama, and art. By presenting questions in an engaging manner, accompanied by colorful visuals and a harry potter theme, the game seeks to capture the attention and curiosity of young learners.

Key features of the game include:

* A diverse set of questions covering various non-STEM subjects
* A very nice theme based around harry potter
* Interactive visuals and animations to enhance the learning experience
* point system to motivate and incentivize continuous engagement
* Progress tracking and performance evaluation to monitor learning outcomes
* This project was developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring compatibility across different devices and browsers.
* intuitive and user-friendly, allowing children to navigate through the questions easily and enjoy a seamless gaming experience.

Our main objectives with this project are:

* Ignite interest and curiosity in non-STEM subjects among children
* Foster a positive learning environment through gamification
